Each successful hit on a target allows the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if all three volleys were aimed at a single target and two of them hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the best result. A volley of Hydra missile fire costs 150 credits."

When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side of the vehicle. All creatures within 10 meters of that side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for half damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore a vehicle’s Armor like other Heavy weapons do. Reloading a wheatcutter belt costs 200 credits per round."
