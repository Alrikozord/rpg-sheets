        "Heavy machine guns represent a large family of air- or water-cooled projectile weapons that are usually fed with belts of linked ammunition. HMGs require a vehicle mounting or emplaced firing position for best results. Attempting to shoot one without bedding it down properly on a tripod or other secure mount inflicts a -6 on all hit rolls and makes effective suppressive fire impossible. An HMG magazine contains enough ammunition for 10 rounds of firing, but each round of firing eats 25 credits worth of projectile ammunition."

Victims within forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save for none. The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter wide hole in anything short of a reinforced wall. PCs with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill can shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all but two meters of the rest."
